# address-book-app

## Description  
The first full-stack project I developed, with React front-end and NodeJS back-end.

Consists of a front-end (reactapp), which GETs and POSTs from an API (server).  

Includes adding, editing and deleting of records pulled from an API.  

Using email as a record's key (email can only appear once in JSON file).  

## Running  
In both server and reactapp directory, call `npm start`.  
Server runs on port 3001, and reactapp runs on port 3000.  

## Development Process  
The biggest challenges I faced throughout development of this application related to the backend.  
This is the first time I have developed a backend/API endpoints, and using NodeJS made the process simple.
